    "div",
    { id: "parent" },
    [

            [React.createElement("h1", {}, "H1 Tag is here"),
            React.createElement("h2", {}, "H2 Tag is here")]
        ), React.createElement("div", { id: "child2" },
            [React.createElement("h1", {}, "H1 Tag is here"),
            React.createElement("h2", {}, "H2 Tag is here")]

// package.json is configuration of node packages manager.

bundler basically packages you app to shift to production.

Packages 2 
DEV and Normal 
Dev :- it is required for development phase 
Normal :- it can be used in production 

=======
~ if we use this tilda sign over here then this will automaticall download 
the mejor verson aviliale in future

^ if we use (carret sign) this sign then it will install the minour version 
if any aviliable.

package-lock.json :-  keep the track of exjact package 
version of that is installed with out ~ or ^

node-Modules :-  it contains all the code fetch from npm
it is database of npm it contains all the dependencies 
it also install all needed  the dependencies required to run that package.
this is known as transectivite dependency.



if you have package-lock.json and package.josn we can re create the 
node moduoles by (npm install).
So it is not required to push the node_modules so ignore it.

.gitignore:- it contains all the code which neede not be pushed in git

just like we have npm we have npx 
npx  execute the package 


- CDM links is not is practice or good way to have in my code
- use npm to install React as dependency
